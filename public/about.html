<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I hold a degree in Electronics Engineering, which laid the foundation for my analytical and technical skills. My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to transition into the software field, where I most recently worked as an Associate Software Engineer. In this role, I gained hands-on experience with SQL and PeopleSoft, and was actively involved in both unit and system testing. This experience allowed me to strengthen my attention to detail, enhance my understanding of enterprise software systems, and contribute meaningfully to development and testing processes in a collaborative team environment.</p>

<p>Before entering the tech industry, I spent a year as a Customer Service Representative handling a sales account for U.S.-based clients. This role sharpened my communication and interpersonal skills while also helping me develop a results-driven mindset. I consistently met and exceeded sales targets, earning recognition as a top performer on my team. The experience taught me the value of customer focus, adaptability, and persistence—qualities that I continue to bring into every professional endeavor. I take pride in my ability to work independently, maintain high standards, and strive for excellence in all tasks I undertake.</p>

<p>Currently, I am actively enhancing my skills by taking the Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. This comprehensive course covers a wide range of modern web development tools and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SQL, PostgreSQL, Git, and Web3 development. I’m learning how to build fully functional websites and applications from scratch, and gaining insights into front-end and back-end development, deployment, and professional coding practices. With this knowledge, I aim to pursue opportunities as a full-stack developer, capable of building dynamic web applications, contributing to tech teams, or even launching my own freelance projects.</p>
