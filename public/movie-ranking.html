 <h1>The Best Movies According to Mary Ann</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Split</h3>
 <p>Split (2016) – ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4.5/5)
M. Night Shyamalan’s psychological thriller really delivers.
Out of the three, Split takes the top spot for me. James McAvoy’s performance is absolutely mesmerizing—playing multiple personalities with such depth and intensity is no easy feat, but he pulls it off brilliantly. The suspense keeps you on edge throughout, and the story builds with a gripping pace. The connection to Unbreakable was a cool surprise, and overall, this film left a lasting impression with its dark atmosphere and brilliant acting.</p>
 <h3>Divergent</h3>
 <p>Divergent (2014) – ⭐⭐⭐☆ (3.5/5)
A solid start to a dystopian saga with a strong lead performance.
Divergent stands out with its interesting concept of a faction-based society and a lead character who doesn’t quite fit the mold. Shailene Woodley’s portrayal of Tris brings heart and strength to the story, and the world-building is intriguing. While the plot follows some familiar young-adult dystopian beats, the action scenes and the exploration of identity give it enough uniqueness to enjoy. I appreciated its themes of individuality and resistance, even if the sequels didn't quite keep up.</p>
<h3>Love Hard</h3>
<p>Love Hard (2021) – ⭐⭐☆ (2.5/5)
A cute holiday rom-com with a modern twist, but a bit predictable.
While Love Hard is light and fun, it lands third for me. Nina Dobrev and Jimmy O. Yang have sweet chemistry, and the film tries to put a modern spin on catfishing and online dating. It has some funny and charming moments, especially for a holiday movie, but it doesn’t go much deeper than surface-level laughs. Still, it’s a feel-good watch for when you want something cozy and easygoing—just not as impactful or memorable as the other two.</p>
